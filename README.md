## Requirements


### WinPcap
This library requires [WinPcap](https://www.winpcap.org/) which comes with [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).

### Photon
Since it's using Photon you also need to download and link [Photon3DotNet.dll](https://www.photonengine.com/sdks#client-csharp).<br />
Alternatively you can also just link `Photon3Unity3D.dll` if you have a Unity based game.


## Troubleshooting

> System.InvalidOperationException 

Try to reinstall winpcap - thats main reason for that error 
Use [this](https://github.com/PcapDotNet/Pcap.Net/wiki/Using-Pcap.Net-in-your-programs) for setup.
